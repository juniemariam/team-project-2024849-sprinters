## 🗂️ Design Decisions

- **MVC Pattern**: Flask acts as controller, SQLAlchemy as model, React as view
- **Factory Pattern**: `create_app()` is used for environment flexibility
- **Decorator Pattern**: Used extensively via Flask route decorators
- **Observer & State Patterns**: Used via Redux and React hooks
- **Command Pattern**: Used for CLI seeding (`flask seed all`)
